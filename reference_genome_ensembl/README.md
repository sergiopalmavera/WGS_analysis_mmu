Most of these files have large sizes (fasta assemply file, gene models in GTF, VCF, etc), so I they were not backed up in github.

However, files (fasta, gtf, vcf) were all downloaded from ensembl release 93.

Whenever an original file was modified, the script can be found in this repository as well.
